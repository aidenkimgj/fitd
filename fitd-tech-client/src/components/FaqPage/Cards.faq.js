               heading='What are 1up, 5up, and 10up coaches?'
               text='Another characteristic that sets us apart - we recognize that when you are at a certain stage in your career, you require coaching from people at different stages of their career too.

               1up coaches are those with 1-3 years of experience in their field and are ideal for people looking to enter the field soon (recent graduates or those in transition) or those just starting a new position. A 1up coach can tell you what skills a career requires the most, what the application and interview process is like, and what to expect in your first year.
               
               5up coaches are those with 4-7 years of experience and have advanced into senior or managerial roles. A 5up coach is ideal for someone with under 5 years of experience who is looking to level up in their company or through a move to another company.
               
               10up coaches are the final destination - they have a minimum of 8 years of experience, including some experience at the director or executive level. These coaches are ideal for those looking to make that same move up, or an entrepreneurial change. These coaches know the trends, market, and movements and can advise on a wide range of upper level career enhancements.
               
               Generally, we suggest that our move-makers (you) sign-up with a coach one seniority level up from where you are but do not be afraid to approach higher level coaches too, as they also have a wealth of knowledge and expertise to guide you towards your desired path.'

               heading='Will my coach write or edit my resume, cover letter, or LinkedIn profile?'
               text='Your coach has a ton of wisdom to impart on you, goals to help you set, and direction to give. For these reasons our coaches don not write these documents/profiles during the coaching sessions. A general review is great to see where you are at but we have other services geared towards full focus on resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles that you get a discount on with your membership. Check them out here.'
